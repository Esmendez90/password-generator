## Motivation

I want employers and users to trust that they can create secure passwords using this password generator. 

## Description

Create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria theyâ€™ve selected. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

## Requirements 

The password application must have: 

* A button that when clicked a random password is generated.
* A series of prompts for password criteria.
* A prompt for the length of the password (at least 8 characters and no more than 128).
* When prompted for character types to include in the password, must be able to choose lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and/or symbols.
* When prompts are answered, then the input should be validated and at least one character type should be selected.
* When all prompts are answered, then a password is generated that matches the selected criteria.
* When the password is generated, then the password is either displayed in an alert or written to the page.
